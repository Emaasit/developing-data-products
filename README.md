## Developing Data Products: Course Project

**crimeVis** was created as my course project for Coursera's [Developing Data Products](https://class.coursera.org/devdataprod-004) class. It demonstrates my understanding of the Shiny framework and how it extends R's already incredible capabilities as an interactive web application - without extensive knowledge of web-programming languages.

crimeVis sports a very simple user interface that requires a single user input (i.e., type of violent crime) through Shiny's **selectInput** widget and quickly creates a colorful **choropleth** map of violent crime rates across the U.S. in 1973. The data comes from the **USArrests** dataset, which is provided in the **datasets** library that comes pre-packaged with all R installations.
