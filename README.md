## Developing Data Products: Course Project

Iris Species Predictor is a Shiny app built with RStudio that predicts the species of Iris flower based on the petal length and width inputed by the user. Prediction is made possible by a decision-tree algorithm called rPart.

The app was not designed to blow minds but simply to demonstrate my ability to create an interactive web app that uses R scripts.

Enjoy!
